A phase-space generator based on "RAMBO on diet" for PyTorch

This is a PyTorch implementation of "RAMBO on diet" (arXiv:1308.2922) providing all the necessary functionalites for phase space sampling. 
It maps the unit-hypercube into the final state particle phase space and can be used to integrate matrix elements with a 
unit hypercube phase space generator.
